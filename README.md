# Sorting Visualizer | Patrycja Bachleda

### Summary
##### A React application that includes 4 different sorting algorithms and creates a visual for the steps that each algorithm goes through. Algorithms include bubble sort, merge sort, heap sort, quick sort

### Objective
##### This project served to learn and apply JavaScript and the React library. While a very basic program (and not perfect in many ways), it helped me to learn about transferring data between classes and rendering components to the webpage dynamically.

### This application can be viewed at: https://patibachleda.github.io/SortingVisualizer/
